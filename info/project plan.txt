In addition to the tasks described above, as part of your project, you and your partner must
create and submit a brief ‘project plan’ describing how you and your partner plan on
working together to complete this part of the project. Specifically, you should include:
• A breakdown of how you plan on sharing the workload of this project between you
and your partner.
• A summary of where and how regularly you plan on communicating about the
project with your partner (e.g. weekly meetings after tutorials, video chat, email).
• A list of upcoming deadlines for work in other subjects between now and the end of
semester.
You must submit this document to the ‘Project Plan Submission’ item in the ‘Assignments’
section on the LMS by 4.00pm, Wednesday 18th April 2018.



• A breakdown of how you plan on sharing the workload of this project between you
and your partner.

Each time we meet we will work on a section together, splitting it into smaller functions which can be completed
individually. Then at home these small sections will be completed and fit together to create the finished product.
This will ensure we each know what we are doing and will not end up doubling up on work.

• A summary of where and how regularly you plan on communicating about the
project with your partner (e.g. weekly meetings after tutorials, video chat, email).

Weekly meeting Wednesday at 12 and messaging cooperation over FaceBook, GitHub and Email.

• A list of upcoming deadlines for work in other subjects between now and the end of
semester.
