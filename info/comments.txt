---Briefly describe the structure of your solution in terms of the major modules and
---classes you have created and used.


on player.action()
1. player calls find moves
2. Player sets up MoveTree
3  player uses minimax and alpha beta pruning to get next move

---• Describe the approach taken by your game playing program for deciding on which
---actions to take, in terms of
---o your search strategy,
---o your evaluation function
Grades the board state based on advantage over other pieces by comparing value of pieces on board
-more pieces = more points
-pieces close to centre of board are worth more than pieces around edges
This is because if you control the centre of the board you can defeat the opponent by letting the board wipe their pieces

---o any creative techniques that you have applied, for example, machine
---learning, search strategy optimisations, specialised data structures, other
---optimisations, or any search algorithms not discussed in the lectures.
-minmax algorithm
-alpha beta pruning



---• Include any other creative aspects of your solution, and any additional comments
---you want to be considered by the markers
