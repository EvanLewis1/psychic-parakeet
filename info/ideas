Find path:
    Heuristics:
    Number of black pieces on board
    Number of black pieces with one white piece next to it
    If neither can be improved:
        Target one black piece
        Find closest white piece and move it next to black, allowing for a piece to be placed
        on the opposite side





Path finding:
    Add function onePiecePossibleMoves() to findMoves.py that finds the moves of one particular piece.

    call this function in possibleMoves()

    This function can also be used for path finding,
        providing the possible moves (edges) from the white pieces to the target black piece.

       Heuristic: distance ignoring obstacles (difference in rows + difference in columns)
